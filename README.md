A C# library for connecting to the satsearch API available at https://api.satsearch.co. Satsearch provides a search engine for space products & services. This SDK provides a C# abstraction that makes it straightforward to integrate satsearch in your C# project.

# satsearch and CDP4

RHEA Group’s [CDP4](https://github.com/RHEAGROUP/CDP4-IME-Community-Edition) platform offers teams the ability to streamline the engineering process by using the Concurrent Design (CD) methodology. The multidisciplinary nature of preliminary space mission design makes it a suitable environment to deploy the CD methodology. The strengths of the CD process have been exploited by various organizations around the world, including space agencies like [ESA](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/CDF) and [NASA](https://jplteamx.jpl.nasa.gov/), and large industry players. One of the key aspects of the CD process is enabling users to rapidly generate and test concepts, necessitating access to a comprehensive library of parts.

[satsearch’s](https://satsearch.co/) search engine offers users the ability to search through an extensive database of space products and services. With over 5000 products and 700 suppliers available through its platform, satsearch is aiming to build the first global marketplace for space. By brokering supply chain knowledge, satsearch enables users to rapidly navigate the global space supply chain to identify the right products and services.

The [CDP4](https://github.com/RHEAGROUP/CDP4-IME-Community-Edition) satsearch plugin makes use of the **satsearch-sdk** to provide a means to easily make use of the satsearch service. Users can perform searches from within the application and by means of simple drag-n-drop create new elements with parameters in a design. Have a look at this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uVmWufaoGw) video to see the result.

## sdk explained

The purpose of the SDK is to enable satsearch in C# projects. The satsearch API provides the means to search for **products** filtering on **categories** and **suppliers**. 

Two tokens are required to access the API:
  - Application Token: A token that can be [requested from satsearch](mailto:info@satsearch.co?Subject=Request%20for%20X-APP-ID) to integrate an application with satsearch. This is sent to the service using the **X-APP-ID** HTTP header.
  - API Token: A token that is requested by each end-user that wants to make use of satsearch. An API token can be requested by a user after [registering](https://satsearch.co/register) with satsearch.

The following code snippet provides a sample of how the satsearch-SDK can be used:

```
// use the Credentials to access the online API
var credentials = new Credentials("your-api-token", "your-application-token", "https://api.satsearch.co");

// The HttpClientService and SatSearchSerializer are created manually but can also be injected using MEF
var httpClientService = new HttpClientService();
var satSearchSerializer = new SatSearchSerializer();

var satSearchService = new SatSearchService(httpClientService, satSearchSerializer);

// query the API for all existing suppliers AND get the first supplier to use in a later Product search:
var supplierResult = await satSearchService.SupplierResult(this.credentials, new CancellationToken());
var supplier = supplierResult.Data.First();

// query the API for all existing categories AND get the first supplier to use in a later Product search:
var categories = await satSearchService.Categories(this.credentials, new CancellationToken());
var category = categories.First(); 

var searchParameter = new SearchParameter();
searchParameter.Categories = new List<Category> { category.Children }; // The API support category filtering on sub categories, not on so-called top-categories
searchParameter.Suppliers = new List<Supplier> { supplier };

var productResult = await satSearchService.Search(this.credentials, new CancellationToken(), searchParameter);

foreach (var product in productResult.Data)
{
    Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
}
```
